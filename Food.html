          <h2>Seaweed Noddles (Php 100)</h2>
          <p>It's not obvious when looking at clear, thin kelp noodles that they are made from the green-brown plant that grows in saltwater. In fact, save for the actual name, kelp noodles, there's not much about the gluten-free Asian food that speaks of the sea—unless they are put into a seafood dish. Use this ingredient raw to spruce up a stir-fry, add crunch to a salad, or in lieu of rice with a rich Thai curry. Alone, kelp noodles are almost flavorless, but when paired with other foods it can change the entire feel of a dish.</p>
